 * @brief This list of constants are used for completing both the forward and inverse kinematic evaluation of a 
 * dvrk system.
 *
 * These measurements are also available from one of JHU's  dvrk website:
 * https://github.com/jhu-dvrk/sawIntuitiveResearchKit/blob/master/share/psm-large-needle-driver.json
 *
 * The kinematic models used in this library are based on DH parameters rather than joint location/direction as defined in the URDF standard.
 * However, the joint limits are the same as in the .xarco model files located in https://github.com/cwru-robotics/cwru_davinci_geometry_models.
